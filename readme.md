# Mini dotfiles repo

Mini configuration to be used when setting up any machine.

On Linux it is based on Nix; hoping it will not rear its head.
On Mac it is based on brew, where supported

# Installation

Just run the `install.sh` script; it assumes that you have a working
installation of Nix on Linux.
